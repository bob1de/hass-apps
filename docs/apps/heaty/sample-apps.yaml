  # Obligatory settings that tell appdaemon where to find the app.
  # You shouldn't need to change these two.
  module: hass_apps_loader
  class: HeatyApp

  # An unique id that identifies this instance of Heaty.
  # This is just needed if you plan to run multiple Heaty instances
  # on a single Home Assistant instance.
  # If set, the id has to be passed with every heaty_* event you emit
  # for Heaty to be able to determine the instance the event is
  # intended for.
  # (optional, default: "default")
  #heaty_id: default

  # Enable debugging output
  # (optional, default: false)
  #debug: false

  # If you enable this option, potentially harmful temperature
  # expressions received in a heaty_set_temp event are evaluated.
  # For more information, please see README.rst.
  # (optional, default: false)
  #untrusted_temp_expressions: false

  # This switch can be used to turn off all rooms (e.g. for vacation times).
  # You may use any switch that has the states "on" and "off".
  # (optional, default: none)
  #master_switch: input_boolean.heating_master

  # Temperature that should be set when heatings are turned off.
  # 4 °C is recommended to protect against frost-induced damage.
  # A value of "OFF" will set the thermostat's operation mode
  # to off explicitly.
  # (optional, default: "OFF")
  #off_temp: "OFF"

  # Here you can define Python modules that should be available from
  # inside your temperature expressions. These modules are imported
  # upon Heaty's initialization, hence you have to restart AppDaemon
  # after making changes to these modules.
  # (optional)
  temp_expression_modules:
    #math:
    #my_custom_module:
      # Optionally, define an alternative name under which the module
      # should be available.
      # (optional)
      #as: alt_name

  # In the following config block, you may define settings that affect
  # all thermostats in your setup. These can be overwritten on a per
  # thermostat basis.
  thermostat_defaults:

    # Delta that is added to the temperature value sent to this
    # thermostat in order to correct potential inaccuracies of
    # the temperature sensor.
    # (optional, default: 0)
    #delta: 0

    # The minimum temperature the thermostat supports.
    # If a lower temperature than this is going to be set, the operation
    # mode will be switched off instead of setting the temperature.
    # (optional, default: null, which means there is no limitation)
    #min_temp: null

    # This setting tells Heaty how often it should retry sending
    # a temperature to the thermostat. If the thermostat reports
    # the set temperature back, no further retry is made.
    # You may find this useful if the connection between Home
    # Assistant and your thermostat is unreliable.
    # Set to 0 in order to disable retrying. -1 removes the limit
    # and causes the temperature to be re-sent until the thermostat
    # reports it back in its state (avoid this).
    # (optional, default: 10)
    #set_temp_retries: 10
    # How many seconds to wait between retryings.
    # (optional, default: 30)
    #set_temp_retry_interval: 30

    # Set this to false if your thermostat doesn't support operation modes.
    # Please note that you won't be able to turn it off completely without
    # operation mode support.
    # (optional, default: true)
    #supports_opmodes: true

    # These two settings can be used to tweak the names of the
    # operation modes.
    # (optional, default: Heat)
    #opmode_heat: Heat
    # (optional, default: "Off")
    #opmode_off: "Off"

    # You might want to use an alternative service that receives
    # the operation mode value.

    # (optional, default: operation_mode)

    # Entity attribute that holds the current operation mode.
    # This is used to detect manual temperature adjustments, provide
    # correct temperature values on startup and notice that a
    # thermostat picked up temperature changes.
    # (optional, default: operation_mode)

  # sensor basis.
  window_sensor_defaults:

    #  before the window open/closed detection kicks in.
    # (optional, default: 10)
    #delay: 10

    # By default, a state of "on" means open.
    # If your sensor reports differently, you need to adjust this setting.
    # If multiple states should be considered as open, specify a list
    # of states instead.
