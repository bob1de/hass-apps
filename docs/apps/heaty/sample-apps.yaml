  # An unique id that identifies this instance of Heaty.
  # This is just needed if you plan to run multiple Heaty instances
  # on a single Home Assistant instance.
  # If set, the id has to be passed with every heaty_* event you emit
  # for Heaty to be able to determine the instance the event is
  # intended for.

  # Enable debugging output
  # (default: false)

  # If you enable this option, potentially harmful temperature

  # You may use any switch that has the states "on" and "off".
  # (default: none)
  #master_switch: input_boolean.heating_master

  # Temperature that should be set when the master switch is turned off.
  # 4 °C is recommended to protect against frost-induced damage.
  # A value of "OFF" will set the thermostat's operation mode
  # to <opmode_off> explicitly.

  # Temperature that should be set when a window is opened.
  # 4 °C is recommended to protect against frost-induced damage.
  # A value of "OFF" will set the thermostat's operation mode
  # to <opmode_off> explicitly.
  # (default: "OFF")
  #window_open_temp: "OFF"

  # Here you can define Python modules that should be available from

    # The minimum/maximum temperature the thermostat supports.
    # If a temperature lower than min_temp is going to be set, the
    # operation mode will be switched off instead of setting the
    # temperature. A temperature setting higher than max_temp causes
    # max_temp to be set instead.
    # (default: null, which means there is no limitation)
    #min_temp: null
    #max_temp: null

    # This setting tells Heaty how often it should retry sending
    # a temperature to the thermostat. If the thermostat reports
    # the set temperature back, no further retry is made.
    # You may find this useful if the connection between Home
    # Assistant and your thermostat is unreliable.
    # Set to 0 in order to disable retrying. -1 removes the limit
    # and causes the temperature to be re-sent until the thermostat
    # reports it back in its state (avoid this).

    #supports_opmodes: true

    # Set this to false if your thermostat doesn't support setpoints.
    # Please note that you will only be able to turn it on and off
    # without temperature support. In this case, the temperature you
    # configure in your schedule doesn't matter. Any value different
    # from OFF will turn the thermostat on.
    # Additionally, a thermostat with disabled temperature support
    # will neither trigger the change replication nor the delayed

    # Entity attribute that holds the current temperature as measured
