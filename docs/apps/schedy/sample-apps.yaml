  # By default, Schedy tries to restore its previous state at startup
  # from the records stored in Home Assistant. This includes scheduled
  # values, manual adjustments and re-scheduling times - just everything.
  # When this behaviour is not desired, change this setting to true
  # and Schedy will just apply the schedules at startup, no matter what
  # the previous actor states were.

  # If you enable this option, potentially harmful expressions received

  # This Python script is executed when a schedule rule expression needs to be
  # evaluated. All modules you import and variables you set here will be available when
  # your expression is evaluated. You can even declare classes and functions. The
  # result types and expression helpers can be used in this script as well.
  # Note: Don't expect this script to be executed as often as the number of rules
  # you have in your schedules. The expression evaluation environment is built the
  # first time a rule needs to be evaluated and then reused for all subsequent
  # rules during that schedule evaluation turn.

  # When you use expressions in your schedules that query the state of
  # entities, you should tell Schedy which entities the schedules depend
  # on. It can then watch for state changes of these and re-evaluate
  # schedules automatically.
  # Note: Entities listed here trigger a re-evaluation in all rooms. For
  # entities only used in the schedules of particular rooms, use the
  # per-room watched_entities list.
  watched_entities:

    # Each entry has to be a string consisting of up to three
    # colon-separated parts:
    #
    # 1. The id of the entity to watch. This is mandatory.
    # 2. Which attributes to watch for changes of, either a single
    #    attribute or a comma-separated list.
    #    The special value "all" listens for changes of any attribute. Try
    #    to avoid this whenever possible as it can increase the load
    #    significantly.
    #    Default: "state"
    # 3. The re-evaluation mode as known from the schedy_reevaluate event.
    #    The special mode "ignore" causes no re-evaluation, it just
    #    suppresses the warnings generated when the entity is queried from
    #    an expression.
    #    Default: "reevaluate"
    #
    # Examples:
    # - "binary_sensor.motion"
    # - "binary_sensor.motion:all"
    # - "binary_sensor.motion::reset"

      # this value is set to 120, Schedy will again apply the schedule
      # two hours after you made the change.
