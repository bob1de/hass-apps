Statistics
==========

Schedy provides a concept for collecting statistical data about its
operation at runtime.

The statistical parameters you can collect depend on the actor type
used. A ``switch`` actor, for instance, obviously doesn't support
measuring temperature differences. What parameters are available can be
found in the individual actor documentations.

What's common among all parameters is that they create a new entity
in Home Assistant, named ``schedy_stats.<app name>_<parameter instance
name>``. The state of these entities is always the empty string ``""``
and thus irrelevant, but their attributes are of interest. The names
and meanings of attributes generated by a specific parameter type can
be found in its documentation. You may then use normal Home Assistant
automations to react to changes of the individual entity attributes.

A simple statistics configuration with a single instance of the
``temp_delta`` parameter, which is provided by the ``thermostat`` actor
type, might look as follows:

::

    statistics:
      # pick an arbitrary name for the parameter instance
      upstairs_temp_delta:
        # the type of parameter as found in the actor'S documentation
        type: temp_delta
        # more parameter-specific settings:
        rooms:
          bathroom:
          kidsroom:
        #...

      # more parameter instances...

Given that the name of your Schedy app instance is ``heating``, this
would create an entity named ``schedy_stats.heating_upstairs_temp_delta``
with the attributes ``min``, ``avg`` and ``max``.
