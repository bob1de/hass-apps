# Here you configure the attributes of the entity to be controlled by the schedule.
attributes:
  # The attribute to be controlled, this could be e.g. "state" or "brightness".
  # A value of null creates a write-only attribute. This has to be used when you want
  # to control a property whose current value is not reflected in any of the entity's
  # attributes. Don't do this if not really necessary, since doing so means that
  # Schedy won't be able to verify that the value has been transmitted correctly. If
  # you must use a write-only attribute, you might also want to set send_retries to a
  # low value in order to avoid excessive network load.
- attribute: first

# Here you configure the values you want to be able to return from your schedule.
values:
  # Each value is a list of the values for the individual attributes configured above.
  # Schedy compares the entity's current attributes against the values defined here
  # in order to find the value currently active.
  # The special attribute value "*" is a wildcard and will, when used, match any
  # value of that particular attribute.
  # Additionally, you don't have to include all attributes in every single value,
  # only the first N attributes which values are provided for are compared against
  # the entity's state for the value to match.

    # Which service to call
  - service: ...
    # Optionally, provide service data.

# Set this to true if you want Schedy to treat string attributes of an entity the
# same, no matter if they're reported in lower or upper case. This is handy for some
# MQTT devices, for instance, which sometimes report a state of "ON", while others say
# "on".
