# When this is set to something different than "OFF", Schedy will
# rewrite the value OFF into this temperature before sending it to
# the thermostat. You can set it to 4.0 degrees (if your thermostat
# supports this low value) in order to prevent frost-induced damage
# to your heating setup.
# This setting is required when you want to send OFF to thermostats with
# disabled HVAC mode support.

# Set this to false if your thermostat doesn't support HVAC modes.
# Please note that you won't be able to turn it off completely without
