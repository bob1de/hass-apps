Welcome to the documentation of hass-apps!
==========================================

This is a collection of useful apps to empower Home Assistant even more.

The apps are built on top of the AppDaemon framework. Each has its own,
detailled documentation and includes a sample configuration. Read the
:doc:`getting-started` chapter and start empowering your smart home.

    Donations
    ---------

    .. note::

       I work on this project in my spare time, as many free software
       developers do. And of course, I enjoy this work a lot. There is no
       and will never be a need to pay anything for using this software.

    However, if you want to honor the hundreds of hours continuously spent
    with writing code and documentation, testing and providing support by
    donating me a cup of coffee, a beer in the evening, my monthly hosting
    fees or anything else embellishing my day a little more, that would be
    awesome. If you decide doing so, I want to thank you very much! Please
    be assured that I'm not presuming anybody to donate, it's entirely
    your choice.

    |paypal-recurring| Ensure ongoing development and support with a monthly
    donation, no matter how small.

Getting Help
------------

.. note::

   **If you run into any issue, first consult the documentation
   thoroughly.**
  
   A notable amount of work has gone into it and most aspects should be
   covered already. When this didn't help you're welcome to e.g. ask in
   the `Home Assistant Community <https://community.home-assistant.io/>`_.

When encountering something that seems to be a bug, please open an
`issue on GitHub <https://github.com/efficiosoft/hass-apps/issues>`_ and
attach complete logs with ``debug: true`` set in the app's configuration
illustrating the issue. You won't receive help otherwise.


Contributing
------------

You are welcome to contribute your own apps for AppDaemon to this
project. But please don't submit a pull request without talking to
me first. This is because there is currently no developer documentation
on how to integrate properly with the environment provided by hass-apps
and I want to save you the hassle of re-designing your app after it's
already written.

If you've got an interesting idea for a new app you'd like to contribute,
just open an issue on GitHub and we can discuss it there.

All contributions are subject to the :doc:`CODE_OF_CONDUCT`. Don't
contribute if you don't agree with that.
