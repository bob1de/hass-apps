=========

**MAINTENANCE MODE:**
This project currently is in maintenance-only mode, meaning that I'm not going to
implement new features at the moment due to lack of time.
However, I'm using Schedy in production myself and will try to fix critical bugs as
good as I can.
Maybe there will be a phase of more active development sometime in the future.
Thanks for your understanding, wish you all the best and good luck with Schedy!

This is a collection of useful apps and snippets to empower Home Assistant
and AppDaemon even more.

.. note::

   I work on this project in my spare time, as many free software
   developers do. And of course, I enjoy this work a lot. There is no
   and will never be a need to pay anything for using this software.

However, if you want to honor the hundreds of hours continuously spent
with writing code and documentation, testing and providing support by
donating me a cup of coffee, a beer in the evening, my monthly hosting
fees or anything else embellishing my day a little more, that would be
awesome. If you decide doing so, I want to thank you very much! Please
be assured that I'm not presuming anybody to donate, it's entirely
your choice.
