Donations
---------

I work on this project in my spare time, as most free software developers
do. And of course, I enjoy this work a lot. There is no and will never be
a need to pay anything for using this software.

However, if you want to donate me a cup of coffee, a beer in the evening,
my monthly hosting fees or anything else embellishing my day a little
more, that would be awesome. If you decide doing so, I want to thank you
very much! But please be assured that I'm not presuming anybody to donate,
it's entirely your choice.
